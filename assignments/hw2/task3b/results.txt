  i. A short description of how you implemented your data structure. Often a picture is worth a
     thousand words. [5 points]
 ii. The average time to perform a lookup. [2 points]
iii. An estimated average throughput of a switch built using this routing table (in packets per
     second), given that you have 40,000 entries in your routing table. [2 points]
 iv. An estimate of the worst-case time to perform a lookup. In the first implementation described
     above (the one that required too much storage), the time to perform a lookup is constant.
     In the second implementation described above, the worst-case lookup will involve searching
     through all n entries before finding the correct IP address (instead of n/2 entries, which is av-
     erage case). I want you to estimate what is the worst case for your particular implementation,
     and measure it. You will have to modify main.c to measure this (it might involve loading a
     particular set of IP addresses into the routing table). In your report file, describe
      A. an estimate of what the worst case would be in your implementation (in terms of the
         number of entries in the table, n) [2 points], and
      B. your measured estimate of this worst case [2 points].
     Note that, although the worst-case time is important, it is the average-case time you should
     be optimizing for in this network switch case.

i. The routing table is stored in a hash table. As the table is defined to be of size 40000, collisions may occur. Collisions are resolved via direct chaining.

ii. The lookup time is based on the IP address in the routing table. The average time to perform a lookup ranges is in the vicinity of 0.172 microseconds.

iii.

iv. The worst-case lookup will occur when the hash function outputs the same index for all the keys (which in this case is the ip address). As a result of the direct chaining, a look-up could potential require traversing all 40 000 entries of a linked list to find a matching IP address. 
    a) In O notation, the worst-case lookup would equate to O(n). 
    b) In such a case, the lookup took 736.54 microseconds per lookup.
